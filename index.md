## Machine Learning

### [NT5?! Training T5 to Perform Numerical Reasoning](./ml_nt5)  

**Models**: T5, BERT, SentencePiece, Transformer  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS      

*NT5?! Training T5 to Perform Numerical Reasoning* is a NLP research on NRoT (numerical reasoning over text) using T5. We are currently in the process of refining the research in response to feedback from the ACL submission.   

### [Classifying Melanoma](./ml_melanoma)  

**Models**: EfficientNet (CNN), Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, Focal Loss  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS    

*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on patient metadata and images of skin lesions. Two datasets are used for the classification: a **CSV (~2MB)** that contains textual patient metadata, and an **image pool (40GB+)** that consists of 33,126 skin lesion photos, of which there are **only 584 positive examples**. A total of three **neural networks** and two baseline models (**Logistic Regression** and **SVM**) are built for the classification.

### [Visualizing EfficientNet](./ml_visualizing_neural_net)  
**Models:** EfficientNet-B0, PCA, Focal Loss  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS     

The study explores ways to visualize the learning progress of **EfficientNet** (a convolutional neural network published by Google in 2019) by extracting embeddings and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using **PCA**.

### [Neural Snaky](./ml_snaky) 
**Models**: Neural Network, Logistics  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyGame     

*Snaky* is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake. There is a twist: the snake plays the game by itself with a brain made of a neural network!

## Statistical Analysis

### [Field Experiment: Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing](./st_gender_bias)  

**Keywords**: Randomized Field Experiment, 2x2 Factorial Design, Blocking, Power Analysis, OLS, ANOVA  
**Tech Stack**: R  

*Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing* is a statistical research project with **an end-to-end** **randomized field experiment** that includes experiment design, data collection, and model building. Multiple other academic researches on similar topics have been conducted and are discussed in the paper.   

### [Regression: Quality on Popularity for YouTube Videos](./st_youtube)  

**Keywords**: OLS, Gauss-Markov Assumptions, Omitted Variable Bias  
**Tech Stack**: R

The study includes an **end-to-end regression analysis**, including an analysis on the **Gaussâ€“Markov assumptions** and **omitted variable bias**, in an attempt to explore the relationship between a video's quality and its popularity one YouTube. In particular, we ask the question: How does the quality of a video affect its number of views?

## Data Exploration  

### [AwesomeBabyNames](./py_awesome_baby_names)  
**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python  

An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! *AwesomeBabyNames* is a Python app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

### [Visualizing Death-Zone Mountaineering](./py_himalayan_db)  
**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy, Python  

*Death-Zone Mountaineering* is an analysis on expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks (i.e. peaks with altitudes above 8,000m) in the Himalayas mountain range. The data visualization project is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering **over 100 years of expeditions** from 1905 through Spring 2019.

### [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/)  
**Keywords**: UX Portfolio  
**Tech Stack:** Java, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS  

Before data science I was a lead software engineer in a WPP UX design agency, leading e-commerce and online interactive experience development for clients including Nike and EA Game (e.g. online stores, web analytics, data visualization, in-store kiosks, etc.). I had also been working on contracts as an UX designer at my own free time. [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/) is a portfolio of select professional projects that I have worked on as a developer or UX designer prior to data science and product management.  

### [Hello, Baby Clara!](./sp_hello_baby_clara)  
**Keywords**: Web Application Development, Photography Portfolio  
**Tech Stack:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS  

*Hello, Baby Clara!* is a photo diary I built using PHP and jQuery. It is a database-free SPA (single-page application) designed for storytelling. It allows me to publish photos with metadata automatically parsed, and the layout is fully customizable. The interactive experience is designed to be enjoyed by both the farther (me) and daughter (Clara) as they grow up together!
